#### Our Vision: The Innovative Tech Braille for Enhanced Accessibility 

Every person deserves equal access to information and education and navigating the digital world can be a daunting task for the visually impaired. We need to recognize the power of technology to unlock new possibilities. So we have tried to create a gateway to remove visual barriers and enable the users to absorb educational material offered through screen share.
