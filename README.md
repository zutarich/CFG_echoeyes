#### Our Vision: The Innovative Tech Braille for Enhanced Accessibility 

Designed a Back-end plug-in for platforms and applications like Google Meet, Teams and Zooms etc., It caters for the solution of Real-Time readability during Screen Sharing, and a front-end to connect with users and better reachability for a *Non-Governmental Organisation - Eye and Eye.* </br> </br>
Every person deserves equal access to information and education and navigating the digital world can be a daunting task for the visually impaired. We need to recognize the power of technology to unlock new possibilities. So we have tried to create a gateway to remove visual barriers and enable the users to absorb educational material offered through screen share.
